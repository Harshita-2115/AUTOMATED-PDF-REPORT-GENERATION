##This repository presents a Python-based implementation developed as part of Task-2 of the CODTECH Internship program, focusing on automated report generation through structured data processing and PDF creation. The project demonstrates how academic data can be read from an external CSV file, analyzed programmatically, and transformed into a professionally formatted student report card.

The core objective of this project is to automate the traditional process of report generation, which is often performed manually in educational institutions. Manual preparation of report cards involves calculating totals, computing percentages, assigning grades, and formatting the document properly. This process can be repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. By using Python, this project provides an efficient and reliable solution to generate reports automatically with minimal manual intervention.

The implementation utilizes the Pandas library to load and process structured student data from a CSV file. The dataset includes details such as the student’s name, roll number, subjects, and marks obtained in each subject. Once the data is loaded into the program, analytical operations are performed including total marks calculation, percentage computation, and automatic grade assignment based on predefined grading criteria. These operations ensure accuracy and consistency in evaluation while reducing the possibility of calculation mistakes.

After completing the data analysis phase, the processed results are passed to the ReportLab library, which is responsible for generating the PDF document. ReportLab is used to design and construct a well-structured report containing the student’s information, subject-wise marks displayed in tabular format, total marks, percentage, and final grade. The library enables the creation of professional-looking documents with formatted text and organized layout, ensuring that the final output resembles an official academic report card.

The overall workflow highlights the integration of file handling, data analysis, logical decision-making, and document generation within a single Python application. It demonstrates how external libraries can be leveraged to extend the functionality of Python beyond basic scripting into real-world automation solutions. The project also reflects fundamental programming principles such as modular structure, code readability, logical flow, and effective use of third-party libraries.

One of the key advantages of this system is its scalability and flexibility. The script can easily be modified to handle multiple students, additional subjects, or different grading systems. This makes it suitable for use in schools, colleges, training institutes, and other educational organizations. It can also be adapted for generating other types of reports such as attendance summaries, performance analytics, or examination results.

By automating the transition from raw academic data to a formatted and shareable PDF document, this implementation reduces manual effort and enhances productivity. It ensures uniform formatting, consistent grading, and quick report generation, making it highly useful in data-driven environments.

The repository includes the complete source code, the input CSV dataset, and the generated PDF output, providing a comprehensive example of automated report generation. Overall, this project demonstrates how Python can be effectively applied to build scalable, reproducible, and efficient reporting tools for academic and practical applications.
